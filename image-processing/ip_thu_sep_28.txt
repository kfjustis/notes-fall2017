*have a cover page for your assignment report

*more linear filtering

*useful for smoothing/blurring

*image sharpening
-moon example

*unsharp masking
-blur the original image
-subtract the blurred image from the original (subtract the Laplacian)
-add the resulting mask to the original
-Laplacian is a way to measure the difference between you and your neighbors

*median filters: principle
-non-linear filter
method:
    1. rank-order neighborhood intensities
    2. take middle value

    no new gray levels emerge...

-median brings outliers back to decent range, whereas mean smooths shape
    -preserves discontinuity as well, meaning it preserves the edges
    whereas smoothing/mean does not

-continuous application of median can lead to patchy effects, start losing details of course

*gaussian
-do the gaussian smoothing first, then downsample, repeat
-leads into face-detection technology; pyramid -> input for machine learning neural network

*assignment 2
-part 1 : image smoothing
-part 2 : image sharpening
-part 3 : gaussian pyramid
