*bit planes
-go look this up you walked in late
-look at all the bytes, each 0-th bit is bit plane 0
                        each 1-st bit is bit plane 1
                        etc...

*color:rgb cube
-lots of ways to represent color

*image enhancement
-contast(?) example

*denoising
-smoothing: make the neighbors look alike (don't just change one neighbor, adjust both halfway for most fair)

*image deblurring
-machine learning

*image registration
-rotated images compared to front-on recognition

*image in-painting
-removing large obstructions

*image stylization
-turning into a painting example

*edge detection
-more like lines of discontinuity

*face detection

*image segmentation

*image matching/dismatching

*image compression
-takes advantage of redundancy
-lossless vs lossy
-video compression
