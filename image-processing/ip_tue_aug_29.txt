slides: #2 overview
*review what a digital image is
-this class only talks about grayscale images

*review sampling and quantization (he wants us to know this a lot)
-references slide 19 a lot
-should have noise in the sampling (never perfect)
-everything is real number (original information) since no quantization yet
-memory dictates the quantization, you can only take finite samples
    -sampling is dividing the timeline into uniform ticks and picking points (spatial domain)
    -quantization ties those points to strict values e.g. float->integer (0-255)

*review dynamic range
-high means much contrast
-low means washed out

*storing images
-2^k intensity levels -> "k-bit image" (ex: 256 -> 8-bit image)
-there is a table on this slide

*spatial vs intensity resolution
-know the difference
-spatial res: measure of smallest discernible detail in an image (measured in DPI in use)
    ex: newspaper 75 dpi, our textbook 2400 dpi
-intensity res: same but for intensity (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)

*aliasing effect
-when sampling is not the same frequency as the original signal (undersampling)
-good example on slide 28

*quantization problems
-false controuing slide 30

*image interpolation
-using known values to estimate values at unknown locations
-4-adjacency

*image resolution
-if you decrease the resolution, it gets subsampled (downsampled)
-but if you want to blow it back up to original size with a lower resolution
    you have to upsample it, which requires pixel duplication

*bit planes

*dimensionality of digital images
-images and videos are multidimensional signals
-images 2d, videos can be seen as 3d
