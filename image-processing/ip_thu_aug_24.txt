slides:
-what is a digital image?
    -> two-dimensional function f(x,y) or matrix
    -> x, y, f(x,y) are discrete and finite
    -> f(x,y) intensity between [0-255] for black->white
    -> top-left is (0,0)
    -> raw image files from nice cameras apparently use floating point values

-digital image information
    -> needs a light, object, and sensor
    -> the sensor converts the subject to digital image, some quality is always lost
       since it has to be turned into pixels

- sampling
    -> trying to approximate a continuous shape as discrete (pp2 "overview", slide 20)
    -> more samples gets you a closer approximation
    -> sample the cells, quantize the intensity values (from float to int)

- stopped on slide 23
