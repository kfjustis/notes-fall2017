*goes over homework 3 again

*hysteresis thresholding
-if you use the same threshold for an entire line, you could end up breaking parts that are already thin.
 we see this problem when using Adobe Flash all the ding-dang time.

-to follow a line, you look at either side of a point for a pixel with the gradient in the same direction.
 By either side, we mean looking tangent in either direction to the gradient of the current point.

*laplacian-based methods
-much more simple than canny
-seems more quick and dirty

image -> laplacian operator ->

-higher sigma values will lose more sharpness
-another way to detect an extremal first derivative is to look for a zero second derivative
-sensitive to noise so it requires smoothing

-make sure you allow users to change the parameters (command line)
