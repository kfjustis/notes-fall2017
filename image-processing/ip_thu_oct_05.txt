*origin of edges
-they mark areas of discontinuity

caused by different things:
-surface normal discontinuity
-depth discontinuity
-surface color
-illumination

*characterizing edges (1D)
-an edge is a place of rapid change in the image intensity function
-take the first derivative, extrema are where the edges go
-you can also take the second derivative and find the 0 points

*effects of noise
-noise is big problem with real images

*solution: smooth first
-to find the edges, look for peaks in d/dx ( f * g ) where g is the kernel
-smooth with gaussian smoothing, then take derivative and the extreme should be apparent

or

-you can do smoothing, then f * g convolution, then take the derivative
d/dx(f * g) = f * (d/dx (g))
-this works because derivative of gaussian is still gaussian and because convolution is associative

*tradeoff
-Smoothed derivative removes noise, but blurs edge. Also find edges at different "scales".

*gradients and edges
-points of sharp change in an image are interesting
    -change in reflectance
    -change in object
    -change in illumination, etc...

*non-maximum suppression


-you can compute both the x and y derivative of gaussian and then combine them for best results
    -by combine: you use gradient magnitude sqrt((Ix)^2 + (Iy)^2) = || grad I ||
    -tan theta = Iy / Ix

-you can also get the orientation at each pixel: theta = atan2(gy, gx)
