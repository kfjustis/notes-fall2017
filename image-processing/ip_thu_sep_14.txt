*histogram assignment

*intensity histogram
-4x4, 4bits/pixel image
-values are from 0 to 15
-you just count how many of each value

-high-contrast images have a more spread out histogram, low-contrast more compact

*cumulative histogram
-the current Q(k) = sum of all previous occurrences

*histogram equalization
-Goal: obtain an output image with a uniform PDF (continuous case)

*assignment
-histogram equalization
-given an input r, you ouput s

pseudocode
1) compute the histogram (H) of the first image (r) -- the source image
2) convert histogram into PDF -> pdf = H / M*N (MN are dimensions)
3) do transformation function --> sk = T(rk) = (L-1)sum(j=0, k)(pr(rj)) (look at the 3.3.1 white slide)
	-where k is any number between 0-255
4) k -> round the (sk) values into real numbers
