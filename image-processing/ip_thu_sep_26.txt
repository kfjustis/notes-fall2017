*image filtering
-def: modify the pixels in an image based on some function of a local neighborhood of the pixels

*linear filtering
-linear case is most simple and most useful
    -replace each pixel with a linear combination of its neighbors
-the prescription for the linear combination is called the convolution kernel

-dividing each pixel value makes it more blurry overall
-blurring reduces contrast (lowers the difference between values)

*smoothing with average vs smoothing with gaussian

-may need to use zero-padding for proper calculations - depends on image size versus the kernel/filter
