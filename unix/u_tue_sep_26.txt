*commands that are symbols
-() executed in a subshell
-{} executed in current shell, etc..

-$() execute command vs ` ` does the same thing

-$(()) arithmetic expansion
$ echo There are $((60*60)) seconds in an hour

-let keyword assigns evaluation -- instead of let you can
also use (())

-[[]] conditional expression where result is a boolean
-using values inside it require the $ to access vars

*for loops
ex:
    for i in 1 2 4 6 8
    do
        echo $i
    done

ex with three parameters:
    for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))
    do
        echo $i
    done

*infinite loops and file globbing

    #!/bin/bash
    for (( ; ; ))
    do
        echo infinite loops [ CTRL+C to stop ]
        sleep 1
    done

*executing from command line without a script
    $ for (( ; ; )) ; do echo hey ; done

*file navigation

    #!/bin/bash
    for file in /etc/*
    do
        echo $file
    done
