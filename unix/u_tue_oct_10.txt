*what is GENI?
-virtual simulation environment for networks and stuff

everything is broken up into projects
projects can have multiple slices (containers)

RSpecs - xml docs in a prescribed format to describe resources

GENI Aggregates - provide the real distributed resources
ex: some rack at a university used for GENI alone
