*New Network diagram stuff

*Why do we need DHCP server?
-Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-means we don't have to manually configure each connection

*DHCP lease explanation
-DHCP client automatically attempts to renew its lease as soon as
 50 percent of the lease duration has expired
-if the dhcp client fails to renew its lease the first time, then it will again when
 87.5 percent of the current lease duration expires
-if the client fails to get network config from a dhcp server, then it
 will use an ip from the range 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255,
 Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
