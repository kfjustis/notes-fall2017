*final exam on Dec. 7th

*regular expressions
-filter text based on matching patterns

*what is a regular expression?
-a regex describes a set of possible input strings
-comes from "finite automata theory"
-used all over in Unix like vi, grep, sed, emacs, and Python

*regex
-simplest expression is just a string of matching characters
-grep and egrep are the main ones (major syntax differences, egrep looks more simple)
-grep requires escaping special characters with a "\"

grep 'cks' file.txt
-matches on any substring containing 'cks'

-the '.' char can be used to match any character

grep 'o. ' file.txt

*character classes
-character classes '[]' can be used to match any specific set of characters
-grep 'b[eor]at' file.txt will match on beat, brat, and boat

*negated character classes
-grep 'b[^eo]at' file.txt will be negation, so only matches on brat

*more char classes
-[aeiou] will match any of the chars a, e, i, o, or u
-/usr/share/dict/words

*more char classes
-ranges can be done like [1-9] same as [a-e] or [a-e1-9]

*name char classes
-[[:alpha:]] or [a-zA-Z], [[:alnum:]] or [a-zA-Z0-9], [45[:lower:]] or [45a-z]

*anchors
-'^' means beginning of the line
-'$' means end of the line
-grep '^[aeiou]d...d[aeiou]$' would be a vowel at beginning, followed by a d, then any 3 chars,
then another d and end with a vowel
