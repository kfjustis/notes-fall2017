*foldr

*look at it graphically in slides

*foldl more like accumulator passing style
-the default value does not stay the same throughout like foldr
-ex: for reversing a list, foldl is better than foldr (linear vs n^2)

*function composition
A -> f -> B -> g -> C |--> this is g o f
-composition is defined with the '.' operator
